What are the differences between var, let, and const?
What are the differences between callbacks and promises?
What are some new features introduced in ES6?
How does a promise work?
What are the common use cases for higher-order functions in JavaScript, and how do they enhance code modularity and reusability?
What are pure functions? How do they contribute to code predictability, testability, and ease of debugging? 
How can objects be used to store and organize data in JavaScript, and what are the advantages of using objects over other data structures like arrays or maps?

Coding Steps:
All questions should be printed to your Browser's console using console.log()
Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.
Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array.
Do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically.
ages[7] - ages[0] is not allowed!
Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic. (works for arrays of different lengths).
Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age.
Create an array called names that contains the following values: 'Sam', 'Tommy', 'Tim', 'Sally', 'Buck', 'Bob'.
Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average number of letters per name.
Use a loop to iterate through the array again and concatenate all the names together, separated by spaces.
How do you access the last element of any array?
How do you access the first element of any array?
Create a new array called nameLengths. Write a loop to iterate over the previously created names array and add the length of each name to the nameLengths array.
For example:
let names = ["Kelly", "Sam", "Kate"];    // starting with this array
let nameLengths = [5, 3, 4];             // create a new array
Write a loop to iterate over the nameLengths array and calculate the sum of all the elements in the array.
Write a function that takes two parameters, word and n, as arguments and returns the word concatenated to itself n number of times. (i.e. if I pass in 'Hello' and 3, I would expect the function to return 'HelloHelloHello').
Write a function that takes two parameters, firstName and lastName, and returns a full name. The full name should be the first and the last name separated by a space.
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns true if the sum of all the numbers in the array is greater than 100.
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of all the elements in the array.
Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns true if the average of the elements in the first array is greater than the average of the elements in the second array.
Write a function called willBuyDrink that takes a boolean isHotOutside, and a number moneyInPocket, and returns true if it is hot outside and if moneyInPocket is greater than 10.50.
Create a function of your own that solves a problem. In comments, write what the function does and why you created it.

DOM Research Details
List and explain the JavaScript methods that enable us to select elements from the DOM.
What is the document object? What are some other methods available on the document object that don't select elements from the DOM? Why is the virtual DOM faster?
What are the differences between the innerHTML and textContent properties in the DOM?
What is the purpose of the createElement, appendChild, and removeChild methods in the DOM?
Investigate the concept of event listeners in JavaScript and how they can be used to respond to user interactions. Research how to attach event listeners to HTML elements and handle events such as clicks, mouse movements, or keyboard input. 

style.display → changes style directly in JS (quick fix).
classList → tells the element to use or stop using a CSS class (cleaner, reusable).

why it's called node element why it's not only element is there any diffrence between them in short please?
Yes — there is a small difference, and here’s the short version:
Element → specifically an HTML tag like <div>, <li>, <p>.
Node → a more general term in the DOM that can be any type of object in the document, including:
Elements (<div>, <li>)
Text inside elements ("Hello")
Comments (<!-- comment -->)
The document itself
✅ So: all elements are nodes, but not all nodes are elements.
In your example:
const todoItem = document.createElement('li');
todoItem is an element node, because it’s an actual <li> tag.

<p>Hello</p>
This has 2 nodes:
<p> → element node
Hello → text node
✅ <p> is both an element and a node
❌ Hello is a node, but not an element

Week 11: JQuery
Coding Steps:
Using any of the tools you've worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice.
When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
A heading should say whether it is X's or O's turn and change with each move made.
A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a dr

Week 12: API's and Fetching
Concepts: Front-End vs Back-End: Build an understanding of the roles of a Front-End and Back-End, and how they work together
Fetching: Getting Data From an API: Get data from a free public API and show it in an app
Tools: Network Tab: Use the Network Tab of the Developer Tools to debug fetch requests and responses
Tools: json-server: Set up json-server to use as a practice backend
Fetching: Creating, Updating & Deleting: Make POST, DELETE, and PUT requests to an API
Fetching: Data Syncing: Keep data synced between Front-End state and a Back-End database

---------------------------

 1. Named Exports
Named exports are used when you want to export multiple values from a module.
Each exported value must be imported by its exact name, which enforces consistency and clarity in your code.
// Exporting individual features

export let name1 = …,    name2 = …, …, nameN; // also var, const

// Export list

export { name1, name2, …, nameN };

//Exporting everything at once

export { object, number, x, y, boolean, string }

// Renaming exports

export { variable1 as name1, variable2 as name2, …, nameN };

// export features declared earlier

export { myFunction, myVariable }; 

//file math.js
function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}
function cube(x) {
    return x * x * x;
}
export { square, cube };


//while importing square function in test.js
import { square, cube } from './math;
console.log(square(8)) //64
console.log(cube(8)) //512

2.Default Exports
Default exports are used when you want to export a single primary object, function, or variable from a module. This type of export allows you to import the value using any name, providing flexibility and simplifying the import process for the module's main content.

Example: In this example, we are exporting the variable by using "export default" keywords.


// file module.js
let x = 4;
export default x;

// test.js
// while importing x in test.js
import y from './module';
// note that y is used import x instead of 
// import x, because x was default export
console.log(y);
// output will be 4
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////




























**Why is let used instead of VAR?
let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, 
unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
************************************





**Read about Execution Context and Lexical Environmnet.

**There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
1.Global Execution Context (GEC)
2.Function Execution Context (FEC)

++ Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script ++ 

**Clouser ???

Encapsulation = “Hide the data inside a capsule and control access to it.”
Abstraction = “Hide the complex implementation and show only the necessary functionality.”
Method overriding: Both Dog and Cat override the speak method from Animal.
Polymorphism: The makeAnimalSpeak function treats Dog and Cat instances as objects of type Animal, demonstrating that the same method speak() behaves differently based on the object.
 polymorphism is advantageous because it enables programmers to create objects with identical functionality, i.e., functions with identical names that operate identically. In some other areas of the OOP framework, you can, however, change some portions of the shared code or even the entire
