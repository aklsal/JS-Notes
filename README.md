# JS-Notes

**Why is let used instead of VAR?
let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, 
unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
************************************

**Read about Execution Context and Lexical Environmnet.

**There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
1.Global Execution Context (GEC)
2.Function Execution Context (FEC)

++ Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script ++
